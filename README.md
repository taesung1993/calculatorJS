#### 3. Use Calculator
 The calculator has as following functions  
  * ***%*** : convert float which is less than 1 into %, for example 0.6 -> 60%, but no 1.2 -> 120%.
  * ***CE*** : delete equation
  * ***C*** : delete both result and equation
  * ***BACK*** : It is like backspace
  * ***1/x*** : It is like 1/n
  * ***close button in title-bar*** : you can close calculator
  * ***others*** : I think that you can know other functions
